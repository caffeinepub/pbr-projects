## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the missing PBR Projects branding logo across the site and make “PBR Projects” the dominant headline in the homepage hero.

**Planned changes:**
- Ensure the user-provided logo image is included in the shipped frontend assets and referenced with a production-safe path so it reliably renders in both the header and footer.
- Update the homepage hero headline so the largest, most prominent text reads exactly “PBR Projects”, keeping supporting English tagline copy beneath it and ensuring responsive layout on mobile/desktop.

**User-visible outcome:** The header and footer consistently display the PBR Projects logo without broken image icons, and the homepage hero clearly features “PBR Projects” as the main large headline with a supporting tagline below.
