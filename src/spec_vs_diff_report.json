  "summary": "REQ-9 (hero headline prominence) appears implemented, but REQ-8 (logo path/asset placement and resolving at /assets/brand/pbr-projects-logo.png) is not met based on the diff: header/footer now reference a different asset path under assets/generated, and there is no evidence the required public asset exists at the specified location.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Fix the site branding logo so it reliably displays in both the header and footer using the user-provided logo image, ensuring the referenced path `/assets/brand/pbr-projects-logo.png` resolves correctly in production builds.",
      "reason": "Header and footer logo `src` were changed to `assets/generated/pbr-projects-logo.dim_800x800.png` (via `getAssetPath`) rather than `/assets/brand/pbr-projects-logo.png`. The diff summary also does not show adding the logo file at `frontend/public/assets/brand/pbr-projects-logo.png` or updating code to match that required shipped path.",

      "reason": "The request specifically called out ensuring the `/assets/brand/pbr-projects-logo.png` path resolves in production; switching to a different asset directory/name is not requested and conflicts with the specified path expectation.",
